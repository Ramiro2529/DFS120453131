        <li>Rest my chemestry - Interpol</li>

        <p>I haven't slept for two days <br> I've bathed in nothing but sweat <br> And I've made hallways scenes for things to regret <br> My friends they come <br> And the lines they go by <br> <br> Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry <br> Tonight I'm gonna
            rest my chemistry <br> <br> I live my life in cocaine <br> Just a rage and three kinds of yes <br> And I've made stairways Such scenes for things that I regret <br> Oh, those days in the sun They bring a tear to my eye <br> <br> Tonight I'm
            gonna rest my chemistry <br> Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry <br><br> But you're so young You're so young You look in my eyes <br> You're so young, so sweet, so surprised <br> <br> I saw a sign says "OK" <br> Gotta take a ride just recline
            <br> in the faraway Got to take some time to realize <br> That my friends they come And the lines they go by</p>

        <LI>Gloty box - Portishead</LI>

        <P>
            I'm so tired of playing<br> Playing with this bow and arrow<br> Gonna give my heart away<br> Leave it to the other girls to play<br> For I've been a temptress too long<br>
            <br> Just...
            <br>
            <br> Give me a reason to love you<br> Give me a reason to be a woman<br> I just wanna be a woman<br>
            <br> From this time, unchained<br> We're all looking at a different picture<br> Through this new frame of mind<br> A thousand flowers could bloom<br> Move over and give us some room<br>
            <br> Give me a reason to love you<br> Give me a reason to be a woman<br> I just wanna be a woman<br>
            <br> So don't you stop being a man<br> Just take a little look from outside when you can<br> Sow a little tenderness<br> No matter if you cry<br>
            <br> Give me a reason to love you<br> Give me a reason to be a woman<br> I just wanna be a woman<br> It's all I wanna be is all woman<br>
            <br> For this is the beginning of forever and ever<br>
            <br> It's time to move over<br> It's all I wanna be<br>
            <br> I'm so tired of playing<br> Playing with this bow and arrow<br> Gonna give my heart away<br> Leave it to the other girls to play<br> For I've been a temptress too long<br>
            <br> Just give me a reason to love you
